    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/freightyard.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Nigel Jones Associates offers advice both to organisations and individuals who are already involved in the UK
      rail industry and to those who are planning or evaluating whether to become involved.</p>
    <p>Rail transport is often perceived as being very complicated, particularly in comparison to competing transport
      modes. This complexity is compounded by its language, with the rail sector having a vocabulary of its own and a
      particular love of acronyms.</p>
    <p>Understanding who does what - and how - in our fragmented rail sector can be daunting. What is the role of
      Network Rail as infrastructure manager ? Where is the dividing line between the responsibilities of the industry
      Regulator, the Office of Rail &amp; Road, and the Department of Transport / Transport Scotland? Where do devolved
      authorities fit in?</p>
    <p>We can help. Our experience is in understanding, being able to explain and crucially being able to navigate this
      complex matrix to the advantage of our clients. Our particular specialism is in rail freight, both in the UK and
      also international services utilising the Channel Tunnel.</p>
    <p>Nigel Jones Associates also offer market research project expertise and transport forecasting models in
      partnership with the Stamford Research Group.</p>
